# SnipShape Screen Capture and Annotation Tool

AutoHotkey 2.1 alternate to Windows Snipping Tool with additional features and
lower system impact. Creates a overlay Gui of Snipped area that can be
manipulated onscreen with shapes and annotation tools added to it. Based on
Autohotkey Snipper tool that places the snip GUI directly over the snipped area vs
the more complex methods of using external windows or retrieving from the
clipboard. Small buttonbar is available to assist with annotation and other tools.

## Requirements

Autohotkey 2.1 Alpha 14 or later

## Installation

Clone the repository to a local folder. If you have ahk2 associated with
Autohotkey 2.1 alpha then just click on the SnipShape.ahk2 file in the base
folder. You may rename the SnipShape.ahk2 extension to something else if you are
using a different file association.

## Snipping Overview

### One step - hold down activation keys

Current key assignments for screen selection (can be modified in the SnipShape.ahk2 file)

| **HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ctrl-Win | Then drag selection to create a snip |
| Alt-Win  | Then drag a selection to copy to the clipboard directly |

#### Two Step - Don't have to hold down activation keys, similar to built-in snipper

- Activation will change cursor (and optionally dim/freeze screen)
- Selection is done with mouse button-drag-release

| **HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Left Win-s | Initiates a snip and changes the cursor to a cross. |
| AppsKey | Initiates a snip and changes the cursor to a cross. I only use this to bind a macro to my mouse. |
| Left Win-z | Initiates a snip to copy to the clipboard (like built in capability). |
| Left Win-o | Initiates a OCR of the user selection |

### Other snipping actions

| **HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Shift-PrtScn | To capture current window to the clipboard |
| Alt-PrtScn   | To create a snip of the current window |
| Ctrl-PrtScn  | To create a snip of the current monitor screen |
| Shift-Win-e  | To create a snip of the current clipboard (if it has a bitmap) |
| Shift-Win-c  | To copy the selection to the clipboard and create a snip of it (if it has a  bitmap). |

### While dragging the mouse to create a snip

- Holding shift key down forces a square capture
- Holding space bar or right mouse button down will allow shifting of the entire box as you draw it

### Hotkeys on Snip Surface

- Ctrl-C to copy the snip and shapes to the clipboard (minimizing snip)
- Ctrl-X to cut the snip and shapes to the clipboard (closing snip)
- Ctrl-S to save the snip and shapes to the a file in the Screenshot folder
- Ctrl-V on a snip will try to paste a new picture shape from the clipboard as
  either a bitmap (if available), or text (if btimap not available)
- Ctrl-D to clone the current snip if on snip background, if focus is on a
  shape, it will duplicate the shape
- Shift-Del will remove all the shapes on a Snip
- RMB Over Snip blank area should show a menu of various snip actions
- Ctrl-O on Snip to OCR the text to lines of text
- Ctrl-T on Snip to OCR the text to html table
