# SnipShape Screen Capture and Annotation Tool

AutoHotkey 2.1 alternate to Windows Snipping Tool with additional features and
lower system impact. Creates a overlay Gui of Snipped area that can be
manipulated onscreen with shapes and annotation tools added to it. Based on
Autohotkey Snipper tool that places the snip GUI directly over the snipped area vs
the more complex methods of using external windows or retrieving from the
clipboard. Small buttonbar is available to assist with annotation and other tools.

## Requirements

Autohotkey 2.1 Alpha 14 or later (some 2.1 features are used including structures)

## Installation

Clone or download a zip of the repository to a local folder. If you have ahk2 associated with
Autohotkey 2.1 alpha then just click on the **SnipShape.ahk2** file in the base
folder. You may rename the SnipShape.ahk2 extension to something else if you are
using a different file association.

A tray icon like this ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cefc4ca7-0a56-4161-82e4-4cd6d2e19176) appear. You may have to un-hide it in the tray.
You can click on the tray icon to bring up some actions or use hotkeys as described below. The right-mouse-button brings up the default Autohotkey menu.
Additional tray icon options are shown in [Tray Menu Options](#tray-menu-options).

## Snipping Overview

### Snip Annotation Examples

|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd92e254-630b-4a71-8e19-38bf83763307)|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5735443f-1795-4545-ac45-db7e03526897)|

There are two ways to initiate a Snip. The One step method where you press a hotkey and click-drag the mouse. The other is a two step
method (similar to windows snipping) where you initiate the snip with one hotkey then later click-drag the mouse. Both are described below.

### One step - hold down activation keys

Current key assignments for screen selection (can be modified in the **SnipShape.ahk2** file)

| **Global HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ctrl-Win | Then drag selection to create a snip |
| Alt-Win  | Then drag a selection to copy to the clipboard directly.<br>You can click the tray message to edit the snip if desired or directly paste into your application. |

### Two Step - Don't have to hold down activation keys, similar to built-in snipper

- Activation will change cursor (and optionally dim/freeze screen)
- Selection is done with mouse button-drag-release

| **Global HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Left Win-s | Initiates a snip and changes the cursor to a cross. |
| AppsKey | Initiates a snip and changes the cursor to a cross. I only use this to bind a macro to my mouse. <br>You may want to comment this one out if you otherwise use the AppsKey.|
| Left Win-z | Initiates a snip to copy to the clipboard (like built in capability). |
| Left Win-o | Initiates a OCR of the user selection |

### While dragging the mouse to create a snip

- Holding shift key down forces a square capture
- Holding space bar or right mouse button down will allow shifting of the entire box as you draw it
- Esc key will abort the snipping operation
- If the selected area is very small the snip will be ignored.

### Other snipping actions that don't use the mouse

| **Global HotKey** | **Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Shift-PrtScn | To capture current window to the clipboard |
| Alt-PrtScn   | To create a snip of the current window |
| Ctrl-PrtScn  | To create a snip of the current monitor screen |
| Shift-Win-e  | To create a snip of the current clipboard (if it has a bitmap) |
| Shift-Win-c  | To copy the selection to the clipboard and create a snip of it (if it has a  bitmap). |

### Hotkeys on Snip Surface

Right-mouse-button click over Snip blank area should show a menu of various snip actions. Below are some additional hotkeys that work on the active snip surface.
One option is to paste in a small picture from the Stickies subfolder of the distribution. You can add/remove your own bitmaps here.

| **Snip HotKey** | **Snip Action** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Ctrl-C |Copy the snip and shapes to the clipboard (minimizing snip)|
| Ctrl-X |Cut the snip and shapes to the clipboard (closing snip)|
| Ctrl-S |Save the snip and shapes to the a file in the Screenshot folder|
| Ctrl-V |Try to paste a new picture shape from the clipboard as either a bitmap (if available), or text (if bitmap not available)|
| Ctrl-P |Open a dialog box to add a picture from a file as a new shape|
| Ctrl-D |Clone the current snip if on snip background, if focus is on a shape, it will duplicate the shape|
| Del |will remove all the shapes on a Snip|
| Shift-Del |will remove all the shapes on a Snip|
| Ctrl-O | OCR the text to lines of text|
| Ctrl-T | OCR the text to html table|
| Ctrl-Down|Minimize all Snips|
| **Snip HotKey** | **Scaling Action** |
|=     | Duplicate and 2x the size of the current snip (without shapes)|
|Alt=  | Duplicate and 2.5x the size of the current snip (without shapes)|
|Ctrl-=| Duplicate and 3x the size of the current snip (without shapes)|
|-     | Duplicate and 1/2x the size of the current snip (without shapes)|
|RMB (Right Mouse Button)|Will bring up a menu with additional options for the snip|

## Buttonbar - F1 to toggle while snip active

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9738fdbe-cc70-45f7-9743-932304beec63)

A toolbar will optionally appear above each active snip to provide a list of
actions grouped into the following. You can toggle the visibility of the toolbar
with the F1 key (while snip is active), or the leftmost X button. Left mouse
button on each button will select the shape to draw next. Right mouse button
will allow you to set options for each of the shapes via a menu. The buttonbar
is useful in case you cannot remember the various shape shortcut keys.

When the focus changes to a different Snip, the button bar will jump to that Snip. If the
focus shifts to another non-SnipShape window then the button bar will disappear.

## Drawing on snips

A number of drawing shapes are provided to cover most of the annotations a user
would need. Use the Buttonbar menus or press one of the keys below to change
into a drawing mode. The cursor will change to the shape you are drawing and
snip border color will change to the active color. After drawing pressing the
space bar or Esc key will cancel drawing mode. These
options are also available from the Buttonbar described below.

### Drawing/Resizing Shapes

- Extra padding is provided outside the snip surface to allow shapes to extend beyond the snip. Once drawn
  only the portion enclosed within the snip will be shown.
- Hold Alt key down when drawing shape to get a 2x a thicker border, pen/text size, blur amount on most shapes.
- When drawing or resizing, hold space bar to shift start location with mouse (except free hand).
- When drawing or resizing, press up/down arrow keys to increase/decrease line thickness for shapes with edges/lines/freehand path.
- When drawing free-hand shapes, Shift key will keep ling straight until shift key is let go, this
  can be used to draw connected line segments, just stop at corner and quickly let go shift and press again
  before continuing.
- When drawing/resizing rectangles/ellipse, Shift key will keep the width/height the same (i.e. square).
- While in draw mode, single clicking on the snip surface (or Esc key) will change back to select mode.
- While in draw mode, holding Ctrl key and moving the mouse will move the snip. Release Ctrl to resume draw mode.
- While drawing line or arrow shapes, the shape will snap at 45° angles.
- When drawing freehand Pen shapes, if you stop the path near the start of the path, the path will enclose itself as if a circle was intended.

## Shape Notes

- When you hover over a shape a focus rectangle/line will appear over it
  allowing you to move or resize it (cursor will change to a resize). If you see
  small focus circle (lines) or rectangle (other shapes), you can click those points
  to resize the shape. All shapes/text can be resized in this manner.
- While hovering over a focus rectangle/line when the cursor changes to a hand you can click, then move/drag the shape around the
  snip.
- When the focus rectangle is active over a shape, and you click on the shape,
  you may use the right mouse button to bring up a shape dependent menu or use
  shortcut keys to perform operations on the shape as described below
